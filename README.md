# R agGrid
R interface to ag-grid.

This package provides a function `RagGrid()` to display R data via the [ag-grid](https://www.ag-grid.com/) library.

## Installation

We're still actively developing and hopefully it'll be available in CRAN soon. 

But feel free to install from github.
You may install the development version using **devtools**:

```r

# the development version
devtools::install_github('no-types/RagGrid')

# then try RagGrid::aggrid(iris) as a hello world example
```
